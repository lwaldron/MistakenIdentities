0.1:
Initial version uploaded to CRAN

0.2:
Markus added checkGeneSymbols and unit tests.

0.2.1:
changes to checkGeneSymbols:
* Added unmapped.as.na option
* set stringsAsFactors=FALSE so output columns are character class instead of factor
* use return(df) instead of invisible(df).

0.2.2:
* license to GPL >= 2.0 (from GPL > 2.0)
* convert all putative gene symbols to upper-case, except for orf.
  This catches symbols that are non-standard because of lower-case
  letters.
* added inst/extdata/genenames_org.csv for full transparency

0.2.5:
* update inst/hgncLookup.R to new genenames.org webpage.
* added hgnc.table argument to checkGeneSymbols() to allow optional
  specification of a more up-to-date map from genenames.org.
* update to 2014/02/09 HGNC data.
* move vignette to new location
* GEO GPL analysis to inst/analyses, not included in build.

0.2.6:
* fixed checkGeneSymbols(x) when x contains NAs.

0.3.0:
* add toupper() to hgnc.table[, 1]
* add additional Excel date formats to inst/extdata/mog_map.csv
* additional unit tests in man/checkGeneSymbols.Rd

0.3.1:
* update map to Dec 3, 2014
* fixed corner case of orf with incorrect capitalization - was being
identified as invalid, but not corrected.  Example was c21orf62-as1,
which now gets corrected to C21orf62-AS1 - see tests/checkGeneSymbols.R.
